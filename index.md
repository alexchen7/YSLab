## 前端開發筆記

Hi there, this is a place for me to learn and practice webpage designing. I will update my notes here and make change on it when I have a better idea.


Side note: The webpage is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It takes this markdown file and spits out the rendered HTML.

### Feb 6, 2021
Please refer to [How to use ::before and ::after](/20210206.html).
```markdown
# :: before ::after
They are used INSIDE an element, but before or after the content.

eg.
<p> This is a generic content.</p>

body {
  height: 100v;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: 5rem;
  }

p::before {
  content: 'hello';
  background: red;
  font-ize: 20px;
  font-weight: 900;
  }
```

There will be small 'hello' with red background before the message.
Usage: When you want to add something auto aligns with your element before and or after.



### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/alexchen7/webpage_test/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
