## 前端開發筆記

Hi there, this is a place for me to learn and practice webpage designing. I will update my notes here and make change on it when I have a better idea.


Side note: The webpage is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It takes this markdown file and spits out the rendered HTML.

Please refer to [How to use ::before and ::after](/20210206.html).
```markdown
# :: before ::after
They are used INSIDE an element, but before or after the content.

eg.
<p> This is a generic content.</p>

body {
  height: 100v;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  font-size: 5rem;
  }

p::before {
  content: 'hello';
  background: red;
  font-ize: 20px;
  font-weight: 900;
  }
```

There will be small 'hello' with red background before the message.
Usage: When you want to add something auto aligns with your element before and or after.

  Non-redundant (NR) is the one used for searching, because possible mistakes or duplicated records were removed.

  Genebank is not always right as sequencing (contamination) or human error (typo, labeling, etc) can be made.--> curated one will go to: SwissProt, RefC

Ethical challenges:

  Problem: Genome disease and drugs studies were focused on wealthy Europeans & North Americans (Caucasians).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/alexchen7/webpage_test/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
